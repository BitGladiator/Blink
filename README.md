## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the server directory:

```env
# Server Configuration
PORT=8000
NODE_ENV=development

# CORS Configuration
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000

# WebRTC Configuration (Optional)
STUN_SERVERS=stun:stun.l.google.com:19302
```

### Client Configuration

Modify `client/src/context/SocketProvider.jsx` for custom server endpoints:

```javascript
const socket = useMemo(() => io('http://your-server:8000'), []);
```

---

## 🎨 Customization

### Themes and Styling

Blink uses CSS-in-JS for styling. Customize the theme by modifying the styles object in `client/src/pages/Room.jsx`:

```javascript
const customTheme = {
  primary: '#your-primary-color',
  secondary: '#your-secondary-color',
  background: 'your-gradient',
  // ... more customizations
};
```

### Adding New Features

The modular architecture makes it easy to extend Blink:

1. **Server-side**: Add new Socket.IO event handlers in `server/index.js`
2. **Client-side**: Extend React components in `client/src/pages/`
3. **WebRTC**: Modify peer connection logic in `client/src/service/peer.js`
